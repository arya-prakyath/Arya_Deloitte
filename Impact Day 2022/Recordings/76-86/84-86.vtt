00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:06.569
S Arya, Arya: It's number eighty-four chapter thirteen in the day of rejoicing

2
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:07.600
S Arya, Arya: fruit,

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.460
S Arya, Arya: though it crushed me.

4
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:16.189
S Arya, Arya: The door of The room stood open, and the sound of a step in the passage made dassary glance up.

5
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:42.039
S Arya, Arya: Louis D. Aragon was coming into the room, and for an instant before his expression changed. She saw all the fatigue that he must have endured during the night. All that he must have risked. His face was usually still, and quite a combination of that

6
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:19.319
S Arya, Arya: he knew that there has been a battle, and seeing the papers on the table, his eyes asked for the inevitable question which his lips were slower to put into it in reply. That's really shook her head. She looked at the papers in quick.

7
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:27.849
S Arya, Arya: Then she withdrew from them the letter written to her by Charles and put the others together.

8
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:37.270
S Arya, Arya: You told me to send for you, she said in a quiet, tied voice. If I wanted you, you have saved me the trouble.

9
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.430
S Arya, Arya: His eyes were hard with anxiety as he looked at her. She held the letters towards him.

10
00:01:43.640 --> 00:02:03.950
S Arya, Arya: By coming, she added, with the glance at him, which took in the dust and the stains of salt water on his clothes. The fatigue he sought to conceal by a rigid stillness, and the tension that was left by the dangers he had passed through, daring all to come.

11
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:17.359
S Arya, Arya: Seeing that he looked doubtful at the papers, she spoke again. One, she said, that one on the steed paper is addressed to me. You can read it, since I ask you.

12
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:28.399
S Arya, Arya: The letter told him, at all events, that Charles was not killed, and seeing his face clear as he read, she gave an odd Kurt laugh.

13
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:38.120
S Arya, Arya: Read the others, she said. Oh, you need not hesitate. You need to be so particular, read one. The top one one is enough.

14
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:45.630
S Arya, Arya: The windows stood open, and the morning breeze fluttering the curtains piece number eighty-five,

15
00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.200
S Arya, Arya: By

16
00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:12.109
S Arya, Arya: by order of Napoleon. A. B. Sailed harmoniously into the room, made the circuit of it, and sort the open again with a hum that faded drowsily into sign.

17
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:28.619
S Arya, Arya: The Argonne read the letter slowly from the beginning to the unsigned, and while Dassie, sitting at the table upon which she lent one elbow, the resting her small square chin in the palm of her hand was them.

18
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:45.599
S Arya, Arya: Ah! She exclaimed at length, with a ring of contempt in her voice, as if at the thought of something unclean. A spy! It is so easy for you to keep still and to hide all you feel

19
00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.249
S Arya, Arya: where the linden trees grow close to the window

20
00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:08.620
S Arya, Arya: in it. Charles spoke lightly of the sacrifice he had made in living daser on the wedding day

21
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.580
S Arya, Arya: to do the Emperor's bidding.

22
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:20.450
S Arya, Arya: It was indeed the greatest sacrifice that man can make, for he had thrown away his honor,

23
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.230
S Arya, Arya: talking together on the stairs as they came down

24
00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:47.480
S Arya, Arya: the Aragon thrust the letters into his pocket the only indication he had time to give to desert of the policy they must pursue.

25
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:57.210
S Arya, Arya: He stood facing the door, alert and quiet, with only a moment in which to shape the course of more than one life.

26
00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.340
S Arya, Arya: There is good news with your, he said to Sebastian,

27
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:14.579
S Arya, Arya: though I did not come to bring it. Sebastian pointed interrogatively to the open window, where the sound of the bells seemed to emphasize the sunlight and the freshness of the morning.

28
00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:30.420
S Arya, Arya: Whoa! Not that written the album. It is a great victory, they tell me, but it is hard to see whether such news would be good or bad. It was of Charles that I spoke. He is safe, Madam has heard.

29
00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:45.369
S Arya, Arya: He spoke rather slowly, and turned towards Dassie with a measured gesture not unlike Sebastian's habitual manner, and a quick glance to satisfy himself that she had understood and was ready.

30
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:04.949
S Arya, Arya: Page eighty-six

31
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.449
S Arya, Arya: end of the day, suggested Sebastian,

32
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:24.780
S Arya, Arya: already drawing forward a chair with a gesture full of hospitality, inviting the Argon to be seated at the simple breakfast table. But the Argon was looking at Matilda, who had gone a rather hurriedly to the window, as if to breathe the air.

33
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:33.329
S Arya, Arya: He had caught a glimpse of her face as she passed. It was hard and set, quite colorless, with bright, sleepless ice.

34
00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:43.199
S Arya, Arya: The Admin was a sailor. He had seen that look in the rougher faces and external eyes, and knew what it meant.

35
00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.510
S Arya, Arya: How much more clearly should

36
00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:05.130
S Arya, Arya: how much more clearly we should understand that is going on around us, if we had no secrets of our own to defend,

37
00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:21.979
S Arya, Arya: in obedience to Sebastian's jester, the Argon took a chair, and even as he did so Matilda came to the table, come and missed us of herself again to pour out the coffee and do the honors of the simple meal.

38
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:42.740
S Arya, Arya: The besides, having acquired the Siemens habit of adapting himself unconsciously and unoptously to his surroundings was a direct mind, lacking self, conscious and simplified by the pressure of a strong and steady purpose.

39
00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:54.129
S Arya, Arya: For men's mind are like the atmosphere which is always cleared by a steady breeze, while a changing wind generates vapors, missed uncertainty.

40
00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:06.249
S Arya, Arya: And what news do you bring from the sea? Asked Sebastian. Is your sky there as overcast as ours in dancing.

41
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:15.410
S Arya, Arya: No, monsieur, a sky is clearing, answered D. Are gone, eating with a hardly appetite the fresh bread and butter

42
00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:17.539
S Arya, Arya: set before him.

43
00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:23.310
S Arya, Arya: Since I saw you the treaties have been signed, as you doubtless know,

44
00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:33.749
S Arya, Arya: between Sweden and Russia and England. Nodding his head with silent emphasis, Sebastian gave it to be understood that he knew that and more.

45
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:50.699
S Arya, Arya: It makes a great difference to us at sea in the Baltic, said the Argon. We are no longer harassed night and day like a dog pounded from end to end of a hostile street, not daring to look into any doors.

46
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.750
S Arya, Arya: The Russian ports and Swedish ports are open to us now.

47
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:59.409
S Arya, Arya: One is glad to hear that your life is on

48
00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:05.410
S Arya, Arya: one of less hardship, said Sebastian gravely. I would have tasted it

49
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:09.850
S Arya, Arya: that he glanced at his lean, hard face.

50
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:25.280
S Arya, Arya: She rose, went out of the room, and returned in a few minutes, carrying a new loaf, which she set on the table before him with a short love and something listening in her eyes that was not mirth.
