00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:04.860
S Arya, Arya: These

2
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.020
S Arya, Arya: consisted of a number of letters from her husband,

3
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.369
S Arya, Arya: Red, and read it, it would appear,

4
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:21.209
S Arya, Arya: and the answer to them a clean sheet of paper, bearing only the date and address lay beneath the hand.

5
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:38.629
S Arya, Arya: The career leaves this evening, she said, with the queer ring of anxiety in her voice, as if she feared that for some reason or another she ran the risk of failing to dispatch the letta.

6
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.969
S Arya, Arya: She glanced at the clock and stood

7
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.539
S Arya, Arya: ten in hand, thinking of what she should write.

8
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.409
S Arya, Arya: May I enclose a line? Asked Lewis.

9
00:00:50.790 --> 00:01:02.820
S Arya, Arya: It is not wise, perhaps, for me to address to him a letter. Since I am on the other side, it is a small matter of a heritage which he and I divide.

10
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.000
S Arya, Arya: I have placed some money in a Danzig Bank for him.

11
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.950
S Arya, Arya: He may require it when he returns.

12
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:23.529
S Arya, Arya: Then you do not correspond with Charles, said Matilda, fearing a space for him on the larger table, and setting before him ink and pence and paper.

13
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:42.650
S Arya, Arya: Thank you, mademoiselle, he said, glancing at her with that light of interest in his dark eyes which she had ignited once before by a question. On the only occasion that they had met,

14
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:50.160
S Arya, Arya: he seemed to detect that she was more interested in him than her in different manner

15
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.279
S Arya, Arya: what appear to indicate.

16
00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.070
S Arya, Arya: No, i'm a bad correspondent. If Charles and I in our

17
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:19.680
S Arya, Arya: you seem to hint that Charles might have such a taste. Then she said, with her quiet smile, as she moved away, leaving him to right.

18
00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.430
S Arya, Arya: Charles, as probably found out by this time,

19
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.669
S Arya, Arya: he answered with the bluntly which he claimed as

20
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.299
S Arya, Arya: a prerogative office calling, and nation,

21
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:39.949
S Arya, Arya: that a soldier of Napoleon's, who intrigues will make a better career than one who mainly fights

22
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:49.309
S Arya, Arya: it took up to spend and route with the absorption of one who has but little time and knows exactly what to say.

23
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.969
S Arya, Arya: By the chance he glanced towards Dassere, who sat at her own table near the window.

24
00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:05.189
S Arya, Arya: She was stoking her cheek with the feather of her pen, looking with puzzled eyes at the black paper before her.

25
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.789
S Arya, Arya: Each time the I go and dipped his pen He glanced at her, watching her

26
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.499
S Arya, Arya: and Matilde with her needle work. Watch them both.
